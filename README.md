401 JS --  David Porter's Lab 13 Express with Mongo
===

## David Porter
  * I created Post, Get and Delete routes in my brewery router.js module.
  * Then I created test for each making sure to return the correct error.
  * The GET test returns a 404 when an ID was not found, or it returns a 200
  * when a valid request is made.
  * The DELETE test returns a 404 when an ID was not found, or it returns a 204
  * when a DELETE request was successful.
  * The POST test returns a returns a 400 when a request is made with no body or
  * the body is invalid, it also returns a 200 with valid input.
  * I was able to understand the purpose if server side routing and was able to
  * implement Express and Mongo.
  * I was also able to get the bonus work completed.
